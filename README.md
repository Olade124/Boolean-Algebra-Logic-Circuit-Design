# Boolean Algebra & Logic Circuit Design
This project explores the simplification of Boolean expressions using identities such as the Distributive, Absorption, and DeMorganâ€™s Laws. It also includes the design and visualization of logic circuits based on simplified Boolean functions. The project demonstrates core concepts in digital logic, including the use of AND, OR, and NOT gates, and shows how algebraic simplification optimizes circuit implementation.
